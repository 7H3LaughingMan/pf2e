Your scene doesn't include changes to the environment around it, though you can place your scene within the illusory environment of a hallucinatory terrain spell. When you create the scene, you can choose to have it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example, wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it. A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the end of it, but you can smooth the program so it's hard to tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it looping. You're unable to alter the program after you create the illusion. Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

It generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can't speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you're trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which it uses when you Sustain the Spell. It uses your spell attack roll for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends. The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion's Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn't take any further damage from it.</p>\r<p>\n<hr><hr><b>Heightened (+1)</b>  The damage of the image's Strikes increases by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=158"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"utility"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":2},"traditions":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions","value":["arcane","occult"]},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"ill"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"somatic, verbal"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target"},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"500 feet"},"area":{"type":"String","label":"Area"},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"2"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration","value":"sustained"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","value":"1d4"},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type"},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw"},"sustained":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"ritual":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Cast as Ritual"},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","value":["auditory","illusion","visual"]}},"flags":{},"type":"spell","img":"icons/mystery-man.png"}

The effect of this spell depends on whether you're attempting to end an affliction or persistent poison damage, and whether you are attempting to help or hinder the target's recovery. Affliction The target immediately attempts its next saving throw against the affliction. You can grant the creature your choice of a +2 status bonus or a –2 status penalty to its saving throw against the affliction. Persistent Poison You can cause the target take the persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast this Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn). Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional flat check against the persistent poison damage. You can set the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal DC.</p>\r<p>\n<hr><hr><b>Heightened (7th)</b>  You can attempt to progress any number of the target's eligible afflictions and persistent poison damage.</p>"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source","value":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=456"},"spellType":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Type","value":"utility"},"level":{"type":"Number","label":"Spell Level","value":11},"traditions":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traditions","value":["focus"]},"school":{"type":"String","label":"Spell School","value":"nec"},"components":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Components","value":"somatic, verbal"},"materials":{"type":"String","label":"Materials"},"target":{"type":"String","label":"Target","value":"1 creature"},"range":{"type":"String","label":"Range","value":"touch"},"area":{"type":"String","label":"Area"},"time":{"type":"String","label":"Casting Time","value":"2"},"duration":{"type":"String","label":"Duration"},"damage":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Damage","value":null},"damageType":{"type":"String","label":"Damage Type"},"save":{"type":"String","label":"Saving Throw"},"sustained":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Can be Sustained"},"ritual":{"type":"Boolean","label":"Cast as Ritual"},"ability":{"type":"String","label":"Spellcasting Ability"},"prepared":{"type":"String","label":"Prepared Spell"},"traits":{"type":"String","label":"Spell Traits","value":["cleric","necromancy"]}},"flags":{},"type":"spell","img":"icons/mystery-man.png"}

The spiritual guardian is translucent and appears to be holding your deity's favored weapon. When you Cast the Spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25. The guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance.

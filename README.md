# Pathfinder Second Edition System

This system adds support for Pathfinder Second Edition to Foundry VTT.

### PF2e Version
v0.310: This is the initial alpha release of the Pathfinder Second Edition system.

Please Note:
- Functionality is not complete with plenty of work remaining. 
- This is a fork of the dnd5e system so there may still be references to dnd5e in places and the assets from 5e are included for now (I plan to use them soon).
- If you find any issues or have any feedback please let me know.

Known Issues (see project issues for full issues list):
- AC is not automatically calculated, Just enter it in the input field.
- Critical damage is not calculated currently.

### FVTT Version:
- Tested with FVTT v0.3.4.

### Installation Instructions

To install the system, follow these instructions:

1. [Download the zip file](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e/raw/master/pf2e.zip) included in the system directory.
2. Extract the included folder to `public/systems` in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder. NOTE: the folder must be named `pf2e`. 
3. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

# Pathfinder Second Edition System

This system adds support for Pathfinder Second Edition to Foundry VTT.

### PF2e Version
v0.338: This is the initial alpha release of the Pathfinder Second Edition system.

Patch Notes:
*  v0.340: Merged in fix for NPC skills from fryguy#3851 AND improvements for multi-attack penalties from FS#5443. Huge thanks to both of you!
*  v0.339: Added weapon traits for Two-Handed, Deadly, Fatal, Versitle and Thown die sizes, damage types and distances.
*  v0.338: Included Feat (SRD) and Armor (SRD) compendium packs 
*  v0.337: Added Feat Browser

Please Note:
- Functionality is not complete with plenty of work remaining. 
- This is a fork of the dnd5e system so there may still be references to dnd5e in places and the assets from 5e are included for now (I plan to use them soon).
- If you find any issues or have any feedback please let me know.

Known Issues (see project issues for full issues list):
- AC is not automatically calculated, Just enter it in the input field.
- Critical damage is not calculated currently.

### FVTT Version:
- Tested with FVTT v0.3.6.
